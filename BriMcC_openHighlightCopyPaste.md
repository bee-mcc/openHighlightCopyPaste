# openHighlightCopyPaste
Input a PDF or image file containing text and highlighting, receive a .txt file containing only the highlighted text. Think OCR but higher specificity.

## Project Abstract
Despite an increasingly digitized environment, users often work with scanned documents which may or may not come with text indexed using OCR. Moreover, it is often useful to extract just a portion of text from a document (how often do you use copy + paste). Think, for instance, of how often one uses the copy+paste functionality. However, this is often not possible with many PDFs and images containing text. Users may be making a list, inputting text into another piece of software, sending small chunks of text, or just saving text for posterity. There are not many open solutions to implement this functionality in scanned PDF files or images with _hand drawn highlighting_ - until now. openHighlightCopyPaste will be the _de facto_ project for those looking to parse their own scanned documents, or for those looking to implement this functionality into their software in an easy way!

## Project Relevance
A myriad of educational goals can be achieved by implementing this project. Test driven development, UML, and object oriented design will ensure that this open source project is developed intuitively and can be read _after it is written, by any developer_. This will serve to increase usability. Furthermore, this project will require teamwork, as it is a medium difficulty problem. This use of teamwork will of course necessitate source control - another practice opportunity.

## Conceptual Design
Confused as to what this means, but I'll give it a shot. Developers will design software to take a PDF file or image containing text and highlighting as a parameter. Using image contouring and OCR, the program will return a text file containing on the highlighted portion. Functionality for end users will be provided, as well as an API to utalize our code in any other project.
